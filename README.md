# ðŸŒŸ Astro-Camomilla Integration ðŸŒŸ

This project is an Astro integration built to be used with Camomilla CMS.
The aim of this project is to provide a simple and easy Frontend integration to easily use Camomilla CMS as a Headless CMS. ðŸš€

## Key Features

- **Auto Routing**: Automatically create routes for your pages based on the Camomilla CMS api response.
- **SEO Friendly**: Automatically set the title and meta tags of your pages based on the Camomilla CMS api response.
- **SSR**: Server Side Rendering is supported out of the box.
- **Transitions**: Compatible with Astro Transition Engine.
- **Easy to use**: Just install the package and add the integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file.

## Usage

Given an Astro project you need to install this project as a dependency.

```bash
npm add @camomillacms/astro-integration
```

Then you need to add the integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file.

```javascript
import camomilla from "@camomillacms/astro-integration";
import node from "@astrojs/node";

export default {
  integrations: [
    camomilla({
      server: "http://localhost:8000", // Your Camomilla CMS server URL
      autoRouting: true, // If enabled, the integration will automatically create routes for your pages based on the Camomilla CMS api response.
      templatesIndex: "./src/templates/index.js", // Default is ./src/templates/index.js
      stylesIndex: "/src/styles/main.scss", // Can be undefined. Can manage only css or scss
      forwardedHeaders: ["X-Forwarded-Host", "X-Forwarded-Proto"], // Headers to forward to the Camomilla CMS server
      cache: { // Cache configuration disabled by default
        backend: "redis", // Can be 'memory', 'redis', 'valkey', 'memcache'
        location: "redis://user:pass@localhost:6379", // Location of the cache server, can be a URL or a path
        ttl: 60 * 60 * 1000 // Time to live in milliseconds or s, m, h (e.g. "1h" for 1 hour)
        keyPrefix: "astro-camomilla-integration" // Prefix for the cache keys
        varyOnHeaders: ["Cookie", "User-Agent"] // Headers to vary the cache on
      }
    }),
  ],
  output: "server",
  adapter: node({
    mode: "standalone",
  }),
};
```

Remember to replace the `server` option with the URL of your Camomilla CMS server.

> [!NOTE]  
> Remember to replace the `server` option with the URL of your Camomilla CMS server.

> [!WARNING]  
> Camomilla Integration for now it's built only for SSR mode. Remember to set the `output` option to `server` and the `adapter` option to `node`.

## Templates

The integration can automatically route templates based on the Camomilla CMS api response.
To register a template you need to create an `index.js` file in the `src/templates` folder.

```
import MyTemplate from './mytemplate.astro'

const templates = {
  'my-template': MyTemplate
};

export default templates;
```

The template register maps the template name to the template component.
The template name is the name of the template exposed by Camomilla CMS.

## Error Templates

By default the integration will search for `'error'` template in the `src/templates/index.js` file in case of an error coming from the Camomilla CMS API.
Create your custom error template by adding your template in the `src/templates/index.js` file like this:

```javascript
import ErrorTemplate from './error.astro'
const templates = {
  ... // other templates
  'error': ErrorTemplate
};
export default templates;
```

You can handle different types of errors by checking camomilla response status code in your error template like this:

```javascript
---
const status = Astro.locals.camomilla?.response?.status // The status code of the response
const error = Astro.locals.camomilla?.error // The error object returned by Camomilla CMS
---
```

The integration will also search for error codes like `404`, `500`, etc. in the `src/templates/index.js` file.
So to handle a specific error code you can create specific templates like this:

```javascript
import NotFoundTemplate from './404.astro'
import InternalServerErrorTemplate from './500.astro'
const templates = {
  ... // other templates
  '404': NotFoundTemplate,
  '500': InternalServerErrorTemplate
};
export default templates;
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Even if this approach is more fine-grained, it is recommended to always declare a generic `error` template to handle unexpected errors.

## Draft Pages

This integration will check for the `is_public` field in the Camomilla CMS response to determine if a page is a draft or not.
If the `is_public` field is set to `false`, the integration will return a `404` status code. If you need to access draft pages, you can add `?preview=true` to the URL.

## Forwarded Headers

The integration supports forwarding headers to the Camomilla CMS server.
You can configure the headers to forward in the `astro.config.mjs` file by setting the `forwardedHeaders` option.

> [!NOTE]
> We suggest to forward the `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers to the Camomilla CMS server to ensure that the correct host and protocol are used in the API responses.

## Styles

To inject global styles, add main (css or scss) in stylesIndex option.

## Cache

The integration supports caching of the entire Astro response.
You can configure the cache in the `astro.config.mjs` file by setting the `cache` option.

```javascript
export default {
  integrations: [
    camomilla({
      cache: {
        backend: 'redis', // Can be 'memory', 'redis', 'valkey',
        location: 'redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', // Location of the cache server, can be a URL or a path
        ttl: 60 * 60 * 1000, // Time to live in milliseconds or s, m, h (e.g. "1h" for 1 hour)
        keyPrefix: 'astro-camomilla-integration', // Prefix for the cache keys
        varyOnHeaders: ['Cookie', 'User-Agent'] // Headers to vary the cache on
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

The cache can be configured to use different backends like `memory`, `redis`, `valkey`, or `memcache`.
The `location` option is the location of the cache server, it can be a URL or a path.
The `ttl` option is the time to live of the cache in milliseconds or a string like `1h` for 1 hour.

### Vary on Headers

The cache can be configured to vary on specific headers.
This means that the cache will store different responses based on the values of these headers.
For example, if you set `varyOnHeaders: ["Cookie", "User-Agent"]`, the cache will store different responses for different cookies and user agents.

> [!NOTE]
> The `varyOnHeaders` option is useful to cache different responses for different users, for example, to cache the response for authenticated and unauthenticated users separately.

## Development

To start the development server you need to run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

An example astro project is provided in the `example` folder.
The dev command will start the `example` project to test the integration while developing.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Remember to serve a Camomilla CMS server to test the integration on default port `8000`.

## Test

We use two primary types of tests to ensure the reliability and functionality of our application:

### Integration Tests

Integration tests, located in the /tests/integration directory and configured via vitest.config.ts, are designed to verify that different modules or services work together as expected.

You can run these tests using the following command:

```bash
pnpm run test:integration
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Our End-to-End tests, found in the /tests/e2e directory and configured with cypress.config.js, simulate real user scenarios to ensure the entire application flow functions correctly from start to finish.

Before running E2E tests, make sure to start development server in e2e mode. You can then execute them with:

```bash
pnpm run dev:e2e
pnpm run test:e2e
```

If this is your first time using Cypress with your current Node.js installation, you'll need to run a quick setup command:

```bash
pnpm cypress install
```

This ensures all necessary Cypress binaries are correctly installed and configured for your environment.

## Lint & Format

Keep your codebase clean and consistent with linting and formatting!

You have a couple of options:

Manually run: To lint and format your code whenever you need, just run:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

Automate with Husky: For a hassle-free experience, let Husky handle it! It's configured to automatically lint and format your code during the commit process, ensuring everything is tidy before it even hits your repository.mit
