## Usage

Given an Astro project you need to install this project as a dependency.

```bash
npm add camomilla-astro-integration
```

Then you need to add the integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file.

```javascript
import camomilla from 'camomilla-astro-integration';
import node from "@astrojs/node";

export default {
    integrations: [
        camomilla({
            server: "http://localhost:8000",
            autoRuting: true,
        }),
    ],
    output: "server",
    adapter: node({
        mode: "standalone",
    }),
};  
``` 
Remember to replace the `server` option with the URL of your Camomilla CMS server.

> [!NOTE]  
> Remember to replace the `server` option with the URL of your Camomilla CMS server.

> [!WARNING]  
> Camomilla Integration for now it's built only for SSR mode. Remember to set the `output` option to `server` and the `adapter` option to `node`.


## Development

pnpm run dev
```

An example astro project is provided in the `example` folder.
